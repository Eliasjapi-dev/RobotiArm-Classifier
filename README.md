# RobotiArm-Classifier
An educational robotic sorting system that uses a 5-DOF PLA-printed arm driven by MG996R/MG90S servos and controlled via Arduino. A Keras/TensorFlow CNN trained on MNIST (≥97% accuracy) recognizes digits 0–9, enabling the arm to autonomously pick, sort and place labeled 3D-printed pieces.
